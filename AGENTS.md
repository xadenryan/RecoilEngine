# AGENTS.md - Coding Agent Guidelines for RecoilEngine

## Local Machine Context

This workspace is currently being used on the following development machine:

- Model: MacBook Pro
- OS: macOS 26.3.1
- CPU: Apple M4 Max (`arm64`, Apple Silicon)
- Memory: 128 GB RAM

When adapting build or test commands for this host, prefer Apple Silicon-compatible binaries and remember that Linux helpers such as `nproc` are not available by default on macOS. Use `sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` if you need the local CPU count.

## Current Project Status

This machine is still being brought up for RecoilEngine development. The current project status is that we are in the process of getting the game building and running successfully on this MacBook Pro.

High-level Apple Silicon status on this machine:

- native `arm64` builds for `engine-dedicated`, `engine-headless`, and `engine-legacy` are working
- the blank-map smoke and deterministic render-validation harnesses are working on this machine
- the narrowed BAR real-content validation fixture is working, but full native macOS playability and rendering parity are still in progress

## macOS Bring-Up Docs

Detailed machine-specific setup, Apple Silicon port status, validation contracts, and same-machine reference-build workflows live in:

- [MACOS_APPLE_SILICON_PORT_SPEC.md](MACOS_APPLE_SILICON_PORT_SPEC.md)
- [MACOS_APPLE_SILICON_SETUP.md](MACOS_APPLE_SILICON_SETUP.md)
- [MACOS_X86_REFERENCE_SETUP.md](MACOS_X86_REFERENCE_SETUP.md)

Whenever Apple Silicon or Rosetta x86 bring-up changes, update those docs in the same change set.

- Required historical context: GitHub issue `#936` (`https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/RecoilEngine/issues/936`)
- Apple Silicon/macOS work must stay additive and maintainable. Do not regress existing Linux, Windows, or `x86_64` behavior to make the new port work.
- Record newly discovered Apple Silicon host dependencies in `MACOS_APPLE_SILICON_SETUP.md` in the same change set that introduces them.

## Apple Silicon Porting Policy

- Record every Apple-specific disable, fallback, stub, degradation, or adapter in `MACOS_APPLE_SILICON_PORT_SPEC.md` in the same change set.
- Keep Apple Silicon and macOS support additive and maintainable.
- Preserve existing Linux, Windows, and `x86_64` behavior unless a broader change is intentionally validated cross-platform.
- Prefer localized hooks, compatibility layers, proxy widgets, and translation shims over broad shared-code rewrites.
- Keep smoke, render, and playability validation inside the engine and repo-local validation scripts.
- For macOS GUI validation, confirm the shell has a visible Aqua-attached display session before treating `SDL` display-init failures as engine regressions.
- Capture a known-good baseline before changing a behavior-sensitive subsystem.
- Treat determinism, rendering parity, and existing-platform stability as separate validation gates.
- Keep workspace-specific absolute paths out of committed docs and scripts.

This document provides essential information for AI coding agents working on the RecoilEngine codebase.

## Project Overview

RecoilEngine is an open-source real-time strategy (RTS) game engine written in C++23. It is a fork and continuation of the Spring RTS engine (version 105.0).

## Build Commands

### Building the Engine

**Using Docker (Recommended):**
```bash
# Build for Linux
docker-build-v2/build.sh linux

# Build for Windows
docker-build-v2/build.sh windows

# Build with custom CMake options
docker-build-v2/build.sh linux -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
```

**Without Docker:**
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir -p build && cd build

# Configure
cmake ..

# Build specific target
cmake --build . --target engine-headless -j$(nproc)

# Build all
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
```

### Build Types
- `DEBUG` - Debug build with full symbols and no optimization
- `RELEASE` - Optimized release build
- `RELWITHDEBINFO` - Release with debug info (default)
- `PROFILE` - Profiling build

### Build Targets
- `engine-legacy` - Main engine build
- `engine-headless` - Headless server build
- `engine-dedicated` - Dedicated server build
- `tests` - Build all test executables
- `check` - Build and run all tests
- `spring-content` - Build game content packages

## Testing

### Test Framework
The project uses **Catch2** for unit testing. Test files are located in the `test/` directory.

### Running Tests

**Build and run all tests:**
```bash
# From build directory
make tests        # Build all test executables
make check        # Build and run all tests via CTest
make test         # Alternative: run via CTest
```

**Run a single test:**
```bash
# Tests are built as executable binaries in the build directory
# Pattern: test_<TestName>

# Run specific test executable
./test_Float3
./test_Matrix44f
./test_SyncedPrimitive
./test_UDPListener

# Run with verbose output
./test_Float3 -s

# Run specific test case
./test_Float3 "TestSection"
```

**Run via CTest:**
```bash
# Run specific test by name
ctest -R Float3 -V

# Run with regex pattern
ctest -R Matrix -V

# List all available tests
ctest -N
```

### Test Locations
- Unit tests: `test/engine/`
- Test sources use `#include <catch_amalgamated.hpp>`
- Each test is compiled as a separate executable named `test_<TestName>`

## Code Style Guidelines

### Indentation and Formatting
- **Use tabs for indentation** (see `.editorconfig`)
- Tab width: configure your editor to display tabs as you prefer
- Line endings: platform-appropriate (LF on Linux, CRLF on Windows)

### File Headers
All source files must begin with the GPL license header:
```cpp
/* This file is part of the Spring engine (GPL v2 or later), see LICENSE.html */
```

### Include Guards
Use `#pragma once` for new headers, migrate ifdef guards to `#pragma once` whenever you edit a header file.

### Naming Conventions

**Classes and Structs:**
- PascalCase: `Button`, `GameVersion`, `RectangleOverlapHandler`
- Descriptive names: avoid abbreviations unless widely known

**Functions and Methods:**
- PascalCase for public methods: `DrawSelf()`, `HandleEvent()`
- Getters/setters: `GetMajor()`, `Label()`

**Variables:**
- Member variables: camelCase or snake_case: `label`, `clicked`, `hovered`
- Local variables: camelCase preferred
- Boolean variables: often use `is`, `has` prefixes or simple names: `Hovered`, `Clicked`

**Constants:**
- Compile-time constants: UPPER_CASE or PascalCase
- const variables: camelCase

**Namespaces:**
- lowercase: `agui`, `spring`, `springversion`

**Macros:**
- UPPER_CASE with underscores: `LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`, `CR_DECLARE_STRUCT`

### Braces and Formatting

**Functions:**
```cpp
// Opening brace on new line
void ClassName::MethodName()
{
	// body
}
```

**Control structures:**
```cpp
// Opening brace on same line
if (condition) {
	// body
} else {
	// body
}

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
	// body
}

switch (value) {
	case CASE_ONE:
		// handle
		break;
	default:
		// handle
}
```

**Classes:**
```cpp
class ClassName : public BaseClass
{
public:
	ClassName();
	virtual ~ClassName();

	void PublicMethod();

private:
	void privateMethod();

	int memberVariable;
};
```

### Imports and Includes

**Order:**
1. Corresponding header (for .cpp files)
2. System/STL headers (angle brackets)
3. Library headers (angle brackets)
4. Project headers (quotes)

**Example:**
```cpp
#include "ClassName.h"              // Corresponding header

#include <cassert>                  // System headers
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include <SDL2/SDL.h>              // Library headers

#include "System/Log/ILog.h"       // Project headers
#include "Rendering/GL/myGL.h"
```

**Include paths:**
- Use relative paths from `rts/` directory
- Example: `#include "System/float3.h"`

### Error Handling

**Assertions:**
```cpp
#include <cassert>

assert(pointer != nullptr);
assert(index >= 0 && index < size);
```

**Logging:**
Use the built-in logging system with severity levels:
```cpp
#include "System/Log/ILog.h"

LOG_L(L_DEBUG, "Debug message: %s", value);
LOG_L(L_INFO, "Info message");
LOG_L(L_WARNING, "Warning: %d items", count);
LOG_L(L_ERROR, "Error occurred in %s", functionName);
LOG_L(L_FATAL, "Fatal error - cannot continue");
```

Log levels (defined in `System/Log/Level.h`):
- `L_DEBUG` - Fine-grained debug info
- `L_INFO` - General information
- `L_NOTICE` - Always outputted (default level)
- `L_DEPRECATED` - Deprecation warnings
- `L_WARNING` - Potentially harmful situations
- `L_ERROR` - Errors that allow continued execution
- `L_FATAL` - Severe errors causing abort

**Exceptions:**
```cpp
#include <stdexcept>

throw std::runtime_error("Description of error");
```

Custom exceptions may be defined in specific modules.

### Comments

**File-level:**
- GPL license header (required)
- Brief description of file purpose

**Documentation:**
```cpp
/**
 * @brief Brief description
 *
 * Detailed description of the function/class.
 * 
 * @param paramName Description of parameter
 * @return Description of return value
 */
```

**Inline comments:**
```cpp
// Single-line comments for brief notes
// Use // for C++ code, /* */ for C code
```

### C++ Features

**C++ Standard:** C++23

**Modern C++ usage:**
- Use `constexpr` for compile-time constants
- Prefer `auto` for type deduction when type is obvious
- Use range-based for loops
- Use smart pointers where appropriate
- Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or `0`

**Synced code:**
The engine has special macros for synchronized multiplayer code:
```cpp
ENTER_SYNCED_CODE();
// synced operations
LEAVE_SYNCED_CODE();
```

### Platform-Specific Code

Use preprocessor directives for platform-specific code:
```cpp
#ifdef WIN32
	// Windows-specific code
#endif

#ifdef HEADLESS
	// Headless build code
#endif

#if defined(__GNUC__)
	// GCC-specific code
#endif
```

## CMake Guidelines

### CMakeLists.txt Style
- Follow `.cmakelintrc` configuration
- Use tabs for indentation in CMake files
- Keep lines reasonably short

### Adding Tests
In `test/CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
set(test_name TestName)
set(test_src
	"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/path/to/TestFile.cpp"
	${test_Common_sources}
)
set(test_libs
	library_name
)
add_spring_test(${test_name} "${test_src}" "${test_libs}" "${test_flags}")
```

## AI Usage Policy

**IMPORTANT:** This project has a strict AI usage policy. See `AI_POLICY.md` for full details.

**Key requirements:**
1. **Disclose all AI usage** - State the tool used and extent of assistance
2. **PRs must reference accepted issues** - No drive-by AI-generated PRs
3. **Human verification required** - All AI-generated code must be tested by a human
4. **No AI-generated media** - Only text and code allowed
5. **Human-in-the-loop required** - Review and edit all AI-generated content

**Maintainers are exempt** from these rules; they use AI at their discretion.

## Important Notes

### Synced Code
The engine uses deterministic simulation for multiplayer. Code that affects game state must maintain sync across clients. Look for `SYNCCHECK` and `streflop` references.

### Threading
The engine uses custom thread pools. See `THREADPOOL` define and related code.

### Testing Changes
- For Lua changes: write a test widget
- For other changes: manual testing procedure required
- Automated tests are encouraged but not always required due to complexity

### Before Submitting PRs
1. Test your changes thoroughly
2. Reference an accepted issue
3. Document what testing was performed
4. Follow the workflow in `contributing.md`
5. Disclose any AI assistance used
